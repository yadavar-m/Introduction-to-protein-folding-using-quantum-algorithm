    "In this protein folding model, the main aim is the find out the minimum energy conformation for the given protein sequence. We initialize with random configurations, then the protein sequence is optimized to the correct sequence which can produce minimum conformation energy. This can be achieved using VQE. First, we obtain Hamilton’s using MJ matrix model, then encode Hamilton’s into qubits and compute with stratifying all the physical constraints. The architecture of the VQE circuit is fixed but the parameters fed to the gates are not fixed, and then to convert quantum information back to classical information we want to measure some particular observables. Then, we use the classical computers to optimize the results and then feedback the results into the variable parameters and compute with present values. Repeat the process until we find the optimal result."
